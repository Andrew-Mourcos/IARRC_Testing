# IARRC_Testing

This project consisted of making a self driving race car to compete in an autonomous robot racing challenge (in 2017).
We were the only high school participating this year and we earned 2nd place, behind the University of Waterloo.

This was an example repository that I made, so the code here isn't really useful (just saying)
