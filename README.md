# IARRC_Testing

This project consisted of making a self driving race car to compete in an autonomous robot racing challenge (in 2017).
We were the only high school participating this year, however we earned 2nd place, behind UW.

This is a very early version of our project (before we really got into it).
The code in this repository isn't in a functional state (this was our testing repo)
However, if you wish to check out the working code you can email me (check my github profile).

Recap: the code in this repo doesn't mean anything.
